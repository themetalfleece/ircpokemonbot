# THIS NO LONGER WORKS, USE THE ALTERNATIVE

## The following projects are being maintained, which provide the same functionality, and are much more extensible: [a server for fetching data by a string similarity](https://github.com/themetalfleece/string-similarity-data-fetch), [a twitch interface for it](https://github.com/themetalfleece/twitch-string-similarity-data-fetch), and a [data populator for Pokemon](https://github.com/themetalfleece/string-similarity-populator)

## Description

Provides all the necessary Pokemon Info (about Pokemon, Items, Moves, Abilities and more).
It responds to commands given by the users at a specific chat room. It has a **typing prediction** feature so it will respond even if the user mistyped.
_For example, a user can type **!data cherzard** and the Bot will respond with Charizard's Base Stats, Abilities, Weaknesses/Resistance etc. It also provides a Serebii and Smogon link for the requested object._

It uses [Pokemon Showdown's](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) database. This Bot will be able to provide info about the new games' database as soon as it's available on PS.

## How to run

Download [this file](https://github.com/themetalfleece/ircpokemonbot/raw/master/IRCPokemonBot.zip) and extract it. Make sure the 3 files are located in the same directory. Double click `IRCPokemonBot.jar` to run it (if it doesn't run, open it with JRE). You need to have Java Runtime Environment installed ([download here] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)).

**Note:** If you get an _Exception_ when you start the Bot or the fields in the configuration screen are empty (instead of having their default values), try one of the following:

1. Place both files in a directory that does not contain any special character (such as _C:\PokeBot_ or OS equivalent).
2. Run the .jar by opening a command prompt/terminal in the directory where the files are located and run the following: `java -jar IRCPokemonBot_Runnable.jar`

## Cloud Hosting

I may be hosting the Bot on a cloud service. To check out the current info, click [here](https://github.com/themetalfleece/ircpokemonbot/blob/master/cloud.md).

### Configuration for Twitch

## Refresh Database

By pressing the "Refresh Database" on the Main Menu, the application will download the latest Pokemon Showdown's files and update its database. You need to use it only when PS has modified its database.

## Mod commands for modifying the config file

Twitch Chat channel mods can modify the bot configuration by sending the appropriate commands to the chat. The format is:
`!pbconfig FIELD VALUE`. The space between them is important. The field must be one of the following (with the correct upper and lower case) and the value must be in a range or free text.

| Field                                            |             Value              | Explanation                                                                                                                             | Example                                   |
